Great, thanks Doctor.
Mrs.  Garcia is a 53 year old woman who comes to clinic for with chief  complaint of  weight gain  and increasing fatigue over the last few months.
Fatigue seems to be worse after eating, she reports sleeping OK but her husband says she snores.
She has gained 5 lbs since last seen in clinic one year ago.
She works at a turkey processing plant. Lives at home with her husband (who works in an office).
She has two daughters who live nearby (28 and 26 years old and both healthy). She is a former smoker that quit 20 years ago.
She occasionally consumes alcohol, about 1 to 2 glasses of beer 3 times per week. She is sexually active with her husband.
Per clinic protocol, we performed a point of care A 1 C screening, hers was 7.4% today. On her last screen, 15 months ago, it was 6.3%.
My assessment is that we should start her on Metformin and have her follow up in three months.
