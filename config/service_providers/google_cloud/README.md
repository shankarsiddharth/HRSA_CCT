This folder contains the configuration files for the Google Cloud Platform.

This folder should contain the service account private key JSON file for the Google Cloud Platform account that provides the text-to-speech and translation services. 

The application needs a private key file for the service account to use the text-to-speech and translate APIs.

The file should be named `sapk.default.json`.

`sapk` stands for `service account private key`

**By default, the file is and should be ignored by git for security reasons.**
